What is this project ?
----------------------

This project is **NOT** the official draco repository.

It is a fork of draco sources hosted at https://github.com/google/draco

It is used as staging area to maintain topics specific to [bostongfx](https://github.com/bostongfx) projects that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.

What is the branch naming convention ?
--------------------------------------

Each branch is named following the pattern `project-name-Y.Y.Z-YYYY-MM-DD-SHA{N}`

where:

* `project-name` is the name of the bostongfx project (e.g `TrakoDracoPy`)
* `X.Y.Z` is the version of draco
* `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of the last official commit associated with the branch.
* `SHA{N}` are the first N characters of the last official commit associated with the branch.
